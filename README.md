# project-1: ReSIPees

This project does two things: helps a user decide based on ingredients what recipes they can cook, and helps a user decide what cocktails they can make based on the alcohol they have on-hand.

## Getting Started

Pull down the repo and add an api_keys.js file locally. The Cocktail DB does not require an api key, so there is a generic call built-in. To use the application, you will need to sign-up for an api key from Spoonacular API: https://spoonacular.com/food-api/console#Dashboard.
